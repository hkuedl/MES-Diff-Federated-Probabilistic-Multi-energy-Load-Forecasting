# MES-Diff-Federated-Probabilistic-Multi-energy-Load-Forecasting
>This work proposes a secure federated multi-energy load probabilistic forecasting framework utilizing diffusion models. The local model and server model quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, respectively, based on forecast residuals. A transformer-based diffusion model is designed as the server model to separately process exogenous and endogenous features. The security of the proposed VFL framework, as demonstrated by the noise filtering capacity of the diffusion model, has been evaluated.
